# README: Generative AI Research & Development

### Overview

This repository contains my work in Generative AI, covering research, fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs), NLP applications, model optimization, and scalable AI deployment. My expertise spans LLM training, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reinforcement learning (RLHF), and efficient model inference techniques.

### Key Contributions

### 1. LLM Fine-Tuning & Optimization
	•	Fine-tuned open-source models (LLaMA, Mistral, Falcon) using LoRA & QLoRA for memory-efficient training.
	•	Evaluated GPT-4, DeepSeek, and other models for domain-specific text generation.
	•	Applied Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to improve model response coherence.

### 2️. Data Engineering & Preprocessing
	•	Built custom dataset pipelines using NLTK, SpaCy, and KeyBERT for NLP tasks.
	•	Processed multi-terabyte datasets with Apache Spark & Hadoop, reducing preparation time by 40%.

### 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) & Accuracy Enhancement
	•	Integrated FAISS/Pinecone vector search to retrieve factual data before text generation.
	•	Reduced hallucinations in LLM outputs by 35% by grounding responses in real-world data.

### 4️. Model Deployment & Scalability
	•	Optimized model inference speed by 30% using ONNX Runtime & quantization (INT8, BF16).
	•	Deployed AI models on AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda) & GCP TPU clusters for real-time applications.
